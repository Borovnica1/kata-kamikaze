Description:
Pirates have notorious difficulty with enunciating. They tend to blur all the letters together and scream at people.

At long last, we need a way to unscramble what these pirates are saying.

Write a function that will accept a jumble of letters as well as a dictionary, and output a list of words that the pirate might have meant.

For example:

grabscrab( "ortsp", ["sport", "parrot", "ports", "matey"] )
Should return ["sport", "ports"].

Return matches in the same order as in the dictionary. Return an empty array if there are no matches.

Good luck!

My SOl:

function grabscrab(anagram, dictionary) {
  const letters = {};
  const res = [];
  anagram.split('').forEach(c => c in letters ? letters[c]++ : letters[c] = 1)
  dictionary.forEach(word => {
    const wordLetters = {};
    let allLetters = true;
    word.split('').forEach(c => c in wordLetters ? wordLetters[c]++ : wordLetters[c] = 1);
    for (let prop in letters) {
      if (prop in wordLetters) {
        if (letters[prop] > wordLetters[prop]) {
          allLetters = false;
          break;
        }
      } else {
        allLetters = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (allLetters) {
      res.push(word);
    }
  })
  return res;
}
