Kata:

Description:
This kata is a slightly harder version of Gravity Flip. It is recommended to do that first.

Bob is bored in his physics lessons yet again, and this time, he's brought a more complex gravity-changing box with him. It's 3D, with small cubes arranged in a matrix of n√óm columns. It can change gravity to go in a certain direction, which can be 'L', 'R', 'D', and 'U' (left, right, down, and up).

Given the initial configuration of the cubes inside of the box as a 2D array, determine how the cubes are arranged after Bob switches the gravity.

See the sample tests for examples.

My Soll:

def flip(d, a):
    if d == 'R':
        for row in a:
            row = row.sort()
    elif d == 'L':
        for row in a:
            row = row.sort(reverse=True)
    elif d == 'D':
        for index in range(len(a[1])):
            flat_list = []
            for j in range(len(a)):
                flat_list.append(a[j][index])
                print(a[j][index])
            flat_list.sort()
            print(flat_list)
            for j in range(len(a)):
                a[j][index] = flat_list[j]
    elif d == 'U':
        for index in range(len(a[1])):
            flat_list = []
            for j in range(len(a)):
                flat_list.append(a[j][index])
                print(a[j][index])
            flat_list.sort(reverse=True)
            print(flat_list)
            for j in range(len(a)):
                a[j][index] = flat_list[j]
    return a
