Description:
A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false

MY Sol:

var isSquare = function(n){
  // BINARY SEARCH SOLUTION!!
  var left = 0,
      right = n;
  var mid = 0;
  while (left < right) {
    mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2)
    if (mid * mid >= n) {
      right = mid
    } else {
      left = mid + 1
    }
  }
  return left * left === n
}
