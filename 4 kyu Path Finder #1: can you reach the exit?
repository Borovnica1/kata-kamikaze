KATA:

Description:
Task
You are at position [0, 0] in maze NxN and you can only move in one of the four cardinal directions (i.e. North, East, South, West). Return true if you can reach position [N-1, N-1] or false otherwise.

Empty positions are marked ..
Walls are marked W.
Start and exit positions are empty in all test cases.
Path Finder Series:
#1: can you reach the exit?
#2: shortest path
#3: the Alpinist
#4: where are you?
#5: there's someone here

My Sol:

function pathFinder(maze){
  var canExit = false;
  maze = maze.split('\n')
  maze = maze.map(row => {
    row = row.split('')
    return row
  })
  function dfs(i, j) {
    if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i == maze.length || j == maze.length) return
    if (maze[i][j] == 'W') return
    if (i == maze.length-1 && j == maze.length-1) {
      canExit = true;
      return
    }
    maze[i][j] = 'W';
    dfs(i-1, j)
    dfs(i, j-1)
    dfs(i+1, j)
    dfs(i, j+1)
    
  }
  dfs(0, 0);
  return canExit;
}
