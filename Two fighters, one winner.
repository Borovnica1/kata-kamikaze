Description:
Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.

Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious. Death is defined as having health <= 0.

Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.

Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter objects.

Example:
function Fighter(name, health, damagePerAttack) {
        this.name = name;
        this.health = health;
        this.damagePerAttack = damagePerAttack;
        this.toString = function() { return this.name; }
}

My Solution:

function declareWinner(fighter1, fighter2, firstAttacker) {
  var winner;
  while (fighter1.health > 0 && fighter2.health > 0) {
    
    if (firstAttacker === fighter2.name) {
      fighter1.health = fighter1.health - fighter2.damagePerAttack;
      if (fighter1.health > 0) {
        fighter2.health = fighter2.health - fighter1.damagePerAttack;
      }
      
    } else {
      fighter2.health = fighter2.health - fighter1.damagePerAttack;
      if (fighter2.health > 0) {
        fighter1.health = fighter1.health - fighter2.damagePerAttack;
      }
    }
    //25 17 = 20 14 = 15 11 = 10 8 = 5 5 = 0 2

  }
  if (fighter2.health <= 0) {
    winner = fighter1.name;
  } else {
    winner = fighter2.name;
  }
  console.log(fighter1.health)
  console.log(fighter2.health)
  console.log(winner);
  return winner;
}
