Description:
The drawing shows 6 squares the sides of which have a length of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. It's easy to see that the sum of the perimeters of these squares is : 4 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8) = 4 * 20 = 80

Could you give the sum of the perimeters of all the squares in a rectangle when there are n + 1 squares disposed in the same manner as in the drawing:

The function perimeter has for parameter n where n + 1 is the number of squares (they are numbered from 0 to n) and returns the total perimeter of all the squares.

perimeter(5)  should return 80
perimeter(7)  should return 216

My Sol:

function perimeter(n) {
  if (n == 1) return 8;
  var memo = new Array(n+1).fill(0);
    function fib(n) {
      if (memo[n] != 0) return memo[n]
      if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        memo[n] = 1
        return 1
      }
      var res = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
      memo[n] = res;
      return res
    }
  fib(n);
  return 4 * memo.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
